Exercise 1:
Modify class GradeBook provided for you in the zip file as follows: 
a)	Include a second String instance variable that represents the name of the course’s instructor. 
b)	Provide a set method to change the instructor’s name and a get method to retrieve it. 
c)	Modify the constructor to specify two parameters—one for the course name and one
for the instructor’s name.
d) Modify method displayMessage such that it first outputs the welcome message and
course name, then outputs “This course is presented by: ” followed by the instructor’s name.

Exercise 2:
Write an application that plays “guess the number” as follows: Your program chooses the number to be guessed by selecting a random integer in the range 1 to 1000. The application displays the prompt Guess a number between 1 and 1000. The player inputs a first guess. If the player’s guess is incorrect, your program should display Too high. Try again. or Too low. Try again. to help the player “zero in” on the correct answer. The program should prompt the user for the next guess. When the user enters the correct answer, display Congratulations. You guessed the number!, and allow the user to choose whether to play again.

Exercise 3:
Write an inheritance hierarchy for classes Quadrilateral, Trapezoid, Parallelogram, Rectangle and Square. Use Quadrilateral as the superclass of the hierarchy. Make the hierarchy as deep (i.e., as many levels) as possible. Specify the instance variables and methods for each class. The private instance variables of Quadrilateral should be the x-y coordinate pairs for the four end- points of the Quadrilateral. Write a program that instantiates objects of your classes and outputs each object’s area (except Quadrilateral).
